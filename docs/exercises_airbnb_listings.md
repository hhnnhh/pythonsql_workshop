# Motivation

We will explore Airbnb data using pandas. Exercises are proposed to the workshop participants.

# Data

The `listings.csv` file (3.57 MB) we will work with can be downloaded from [Inside Airbnb](http://data.insideairbnb.com/germany/be/berlin/2019-07-11/visualisations/listings.csv). It consists of 24437 records of airbnb listings in Berlin, compiled on 11 July, 2019. Please place it in the '../data/csv' folder.

# Code

The main script we will use is `../scripts/airbnb_listings.py`.

# Exercises

1. Which are the most common room types?

2. Which are the 10 most expensive properties and their neighbourhoods? 

3. What is the maximum price each host asks for a property?

4. How much is the average price for a private room in the Moabit area?
*Tip: look for the string `Moabit` in the neighbourhood names using `.str.find`.*

5. Plot the number of properties with prices under 20 â‚¬ per neighbourhood.
