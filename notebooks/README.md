# This file

We will show how to work with jupyter notebooks.

# Start jupyter notebook

`cd` to this folder.

Start jupyter notebook by activating the conda environment you are going to work with:

```bash
conda activate pythonsql
```

and just typing:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

A tab will open in your browser with the file structure of the folder where you called jupyter notebook.

# Create your first notebook

1. Open a new notebook by clicking on "New" - "Python 3" on the top right corner.

2. Type python code, e.g. `print("Hello world")`.

3. Ctr + Enter to execute your cell.

4. Add more cells by clicking on "+". A shortcut is to click on the outside left of the cell and press "b".

5. Save your notebook in a .ipynb file.
